## A. Data and Files

This project uses real clinical trial data from OUCRU. The data includes:

1. **Main Dataset**:
    - **File**: "2-10-2020-_03TS_V1_Data.xls"
    - Contains most information. Variable explanations are in the statistical plan file ("03TS analysis plan V1.5 November 2020 Accept changes.docx").
    
2. **Treatment Allocation**:
    - **File**: "03TS_Randlist.xlsx"
    - Includes treatment arm allocations and a "dictionary" sheet explaining the four arms.
    
3. **Violations, Exclusions, Withdrawals**:
    - **File**: "Protocol violations, exclusions, withdrawals.xlsx"
    
4. **Statistical Plan**:
    - **File**: "03TS analysis plan V1.5 November 2020 Accept changes.docx"
    - Provides guidance on specific variables.

## B. Objectives

### I. Data Preparation
Prepare data for the following populations:

- IT-ITT, IM_ITT, IT_PP, IM_PP, IM_ALL.

- Use "03TS_Randlist.xlsx" for allocation of the first 272 participants.

- Use "Protocol violations, exclusions, withdrawals.xlsx" for filtering data per population.

### II. Table Creation

#### 1. Baseline Characteristics:
Summarize as follows:

- **Numeric Data**: Report median, 1st/3rd quartiles, lowest, and highest values.
- **Categorical Data**: Report count (n) and percentage (%).
- No formal statistical comparisons between study arms.

Characteristics to summarize:

1. **Patient Details**:
    - Sex, age, BMI (BMI = ADM.WEIGHT / (ADM.HEIGHT)^2).
    
2. **Past Medical History**:
    - Variables like ADM.HYPERTENSION, ADM.MYOCARDIALINFART, ADM.SEVERELIVER, etc.
    
3. **Patient History**:
    - Duration of illness, incubation period, respiratory rate, platelet count, etc.
    
4. **Specific Severity Scores**:
    - Tetanus Severity, SOFA, APACHE II (calculated from variables).

#### 2. Adverse Events (AE):
Summarize proportions of individuals with AEs, categorized by grade (I-IV) and relation to treatment.

- Exclude specific events (e.g., "Nasogastric tube", "Tracheostomy").
- Use chi-square or Fisherâ€™s exact test for comparisons.
- Severe adverse events are summarized separately for each population.

### III. Plots

#### 1. Create histograms for:

- **Pipecuronium**:
    1. Total dose during hospital stay (ventilated patients).
    2. Duration of use (ventilated patients).
    
- **Diazepam**:
    1. Total dose during hospital stay.
    
- **Midazolam**:
    1. Total dose during hospital stay.
    
- **Benzodiazepines**:
    1. Total dose as diazepam equivalent.
    2. Total duration of use.

#### 2. Create line plot for:
Create a line plot of the daily maximum temperature for each patient during the first 7 days after admission. Use one colour for each treatment arm and make the mean temperature for each day bold for each patient.
